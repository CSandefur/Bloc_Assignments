1. 

a) lineOrder = ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"];

b) lineOrder.push("Mary");

c) lineOrder.indexOf("Josh");

d) lineOrder.indexOf("Emily"); 
It should return -1 if it cannot be found. 

e) lineOrder.splice(lineOrder.indexOf("Ava"), 0, "Melissa");

f) lineOrder.splice(lineOrder.indexOf("Patrick"), 1);
