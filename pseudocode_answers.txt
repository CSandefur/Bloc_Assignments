Short Answer

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

Programmers use pseudocode to sort out their logic before actually programming in a language. It's kind of like planning your route before you get in the car. 

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

Nothing would happen. Pseudocode is meant to be read by humans, not computers.

Programming Assignment

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF the numbers are equal
  PRINT "The Numbers are equal." 
ELSE IF the first number is greater than the second number
  PRINT first number
ELSE
  PRINT second number
END IF

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

FOR each digit from 1-100
Increment by 1
ENDFOR at 100

Based on the linked article, I think you may be able to simply say:

FOR each digit from 1-100
ENDFOR

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
+
INPUT entry information
FOR each entry in list
IF entry is equal to entry information
  RETURN entry 
ENDFOR
RETURN "Entry Not Found"

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

function phonebookSearch (entrySearch, phonebook) {
  for (let i = 0; i < phonebook.length; i++) {
    if (phonebook[i] === entrySearch) {
      return ("The entry " + phonebook[i] + " is found at index " + i);
      console.log(phonebook[i]);
    }
  }
  return "Entry not found."
}
